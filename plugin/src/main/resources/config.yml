# NoChatReports Configuration
# --------------------------------------------
#
# The default configuration settings should be
# fine for most servers. However, you may choose
# to modify them to suit your needs.


# -- Server Chat Settings --

# Enable this to make the plugin modify chat
# packets in order to remove chat signatures
# going FROM the server TO the client. This
# will prevent the clients from being able to
# report the other players' chat messages.
strip-server-chat-signatures: true


# -- Other Server Related Settings --

# A pop-up will be shown to players when they
# join the server if this is set to false.
#
# Hiding is enabled by default since it tends
# to scare players, or at the very least,
# annoy them while bringing no real value.
hide-scary-popup: true


# -- Client Chat Settings --

# Enable this to make the plugin modify chat
# packets in order to remove chat signatures
# coming FROM the clients. This will act as if
# the client never sent the signature in the
# first place. - Mimics the behavior of the
# Fabric mod "NoChatReports".
strip-client-chat-signatures: false


# -- Anti-kick settings. --
# Works on PAPER ONLY.

# This is the message that will be sent to the
# player when the server attempts to kick them
# for invalid chat message errors. Since the
# chat validation feature is highly sensitive
# to any minor missed packet or inconsistency,
# this message may be sent to players around
# once every few days.
prevented-kick-message: "&cYou were almost kicked for invalid chat messages. However, we prevented this from happening. You may need to rejoin to chat again. We're sorry for the inconvenience!"

# This will prevent the server from kicking
# players for the following reasons. This
# will not work on Spigot servers.
invalid-kick-reasons:
  - TOO_MANY_PENDING_CHATS
  - UNSIGNED_CHAT
  - CHAT_VALIDATION_FAILED
  - EXPIRED_PROFILE_PUBLIC_KEY
  - OUT_OF_ORDER_CHAT


# -- Essentials/ViaVersion Settings --
# Because we believe in user choice...
#
# EssentialsX and ViaVersion are two plugins that are known to
# complain about servers installing plugins similar to this one.
# They will display a huge warning or error message in the console
# purely based on detecting the name of plugins they dislike.
# Please note that this is purely based on opinion and not due to
# any true dangers about this plugin. Feel free to read the source
# code and see for yourself...
#
# We've never had to blacklist a plugin or warn against its usage
# since we feel like it's not our role as developers to moderate
# the plugins that server owners want to use. If a plugin is
# truly incompatible with ours, support channels are available to
# resolve the issue, not just complain about it. If you agree with
# this, please take the time to write a respectful yet unambiguous
# review pressuring these 2 plugins to stop this unnecessary and
# unwanted behavior. (Should their behavior change, this setting
# will be removed.)
#
# Set to false is you want to see massive red spam "errors" in your
# console.
