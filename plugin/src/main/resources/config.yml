# NoChatReports Configuration
# --------------------------------------------

# THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS SHOULD WORK
# FINE FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF SERVERS.

# The plugin is designed to be plug-and-play.
# You likely do not need to change any settings.
# However, you have the option to modify them in
# order to suit your needs.

# Note:
# This plugin will not (and likely never will)
# prevent players from having their skins and
# usernames reported. It only blocks chat
# reporting, as the name implies, and the
# related popups.


# --------------------------
# -- Server Chat Settings --
# --------------------------

# Enable this to make the plugin modify chat
# packets in order to remove chat signatures
# going FROM the server TO the client. This
# will prevent the clients from being able to
# report the other players' chat messages.
strip-server-chat-signatures: true


# -----------------------------------
# -- Other Server Related Settings --
# -----------------------------------

# A pop-up will be shown to players when they
# join the server if this is set to false.
#
# Hiding is enabled by default since it tends
# to scare players, or at the very least,
# annoy them while bringing no real value.
hide-scary-popup: true


# -------------------------
# -- Anti-kick settings. --
# -------------------------

# Works on PAPER ONLY.

# This is the message that will be sent to the
# player when the server attempts to kick them
# for invalid chat message errors. Since the
# chat validation feature is highly sensitive
# to any minor missed packet or inconsistency,
# this message may be sent to players about
# once every few days.
prevented-kick-message: "&cYou were almost kicked for invalid chat messages. However, we prevented this from happening. You may need to rejoin to chat again. We're sorry for the inconvenience!"

# This will prevent the server from kicking
# players for the following reasons. This
# will not work on Spigot servers.
invalid-kick-reasons:
  - TOO_MANY_PENDING_CHATS
  - UNSIGNED_CHAT
  - CHAT_VALIDATION_FAILED
  - EXPIRED_PROFILE_PUBLIC_KEY
  - OUT_OF_ORDER_CHAT

# Useful for providing context to the developers
debug-mode: false

# The plugin will inform you of potential issues when 1.20.5+ clients
# attempt to join on a 1.20.4 server (or lower). The warning is only
# shown once per reboot but I understand if you would rather never
# see it again. To hide this warning, set this option to false.

# -- Essentials/ViaVersion Settings --
# ------------------------------------

# Reading below is likely a waste of your time, but I feel
# as though it is important to provide the information if
# you happen to want it.
# You were warned :)

# This setting exists because we believe in user choice...
#
# EssentialsX and ViaVersion are two plugins that are known to
# complain about servers installing plugins similar to this one.
# They will display a huge warning or error message in the console
# purely based on detecting the name of plugins they dislike.
# Please note that this is purely based on opinions and not due to
# any true dangers about this (or similar) plugins. Feel free to read
# the source code and see for yourself...
#
# We've never had to blacklist a plugin or warn against its usage
# since we feel like it's not our role as developers to moderate
# the plugins that server owners want to use. If a plugin is
# truly incompatible with ours, support channels are available to
# resolve the issue. Scary warnings are not the solution. If you
# agree with this, please take the time to write a respectful yet
# unambiguous review pressuring these 2 plugins to stop this
# unnecessary and unwanted policing behavior. (Should their behavior
# change, this setting will be removed.)
#
# Set to false if you want to see the massive warnings and "errors" in
# your console about this issue. I assume that you don't care or have
# time to deal with petty arguments, so I set it to true for you by
# default. <3
